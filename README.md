# Backend System Design Using Queue

This project implements a robust and scalable backend system that efficiently manages requests from multiple users using a queue structure. Each client connected will have its queue where all requests will be processed sequentially.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**: Securely authenticate users before they can enqueue requests.
2. **Request Queueing**: Implement a queue for each client to handle requests in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner.
3. **Request Processing**: Develop a process to handle and execute requests sequentially.
4. **Concurrency Management**: Handle multiple clients and their queues concurrently.
5. **Scalability**: Ensure the system can scale to handle an increasing number of users and requests without degradation in performance.
6. **Robustness**: Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms to manage failures without data loss.
7. **Logging and Monitoring**: Set up logging for tracking request handling and system monitoring for performance metrics.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Node.js with Express
- **Messaging/Queueing System**: Redis
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Monitoring Tools**: Grafana

## System Architecture

The system is designed using a client-server model. Users interact with the system through a client interface that sends requests to the server. Each client connection has a dedicated queue managed by Redis. A queue manager handles the creation, management, and deletion of queues, and dedicated worker processes pull requests from queues and execute them sequentially.
